<p class="text">Cleveland Cavaliers superstar Kyrie Irving is hoping for a big screen slam dunk.
Sources tell Variety that Temple Hill Entertainment has acquired the feature film rights to Irving’s “Uncle Drew” Pepsi commercials. “Skiptrace” scribe Jay Longino is set to write the script and Irving is attached to reprise the role of Drew.
Temple Hill’s Marty Bowen, Wyck Godfrey, and John Fischer will produce the film, described as a love letter to basketball. The original Pepsi Max advertisements showed Irving, in full make-up, playing a 70-plus-year-old man, Drew, who would show up to pick-up basketball games and school kids half his age, while also reminiscing about how the game used to be played.
Fischer was a big fan of the online shorts and showed them to Bowen thinking they could possibly turn it into a movie. But it was Longino’s pitch that really got them excited about pursuing the rights for a feature film.
“Marty and I had recently sold a pitch to Fox 2000, so he and John reached out and asked if I was interested in bringing them a take,” Longino told Variety. “Looking back, I think I tried to play it cool with them on the phone and told them that I’d think about it. But the truth is, I was pretty fired up. As both a former player and a die-hard fan, this truly is a dream project for me.”
